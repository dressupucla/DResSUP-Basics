## Publishing platforms

There are so many options for publishing your work online today. Here's a roundup of some options you might consider:

Wordpress, Omeka, and Scalar are all content management systems that you might find useful. These systems require a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack, so you will need dedicated server space with web hosting.

* HumSpace (http://humspace.ucla.edu/) - CDH's pilot program for UCLA Humanities students. Looks like it is Reclaim Hosting repackaged for UCLA. Offers one-click install of Wordpress. Omeka, Scalar, and other programs can be manually installed. Pilot runs through October. Students can migrate their content after the decision is made by CDH of whether or not they will extend this service.
* Reclaim Hosting (https://reclaimhosting.com) - cheap web hosting for students. Offers one-click installs of Wordpress, Omeka, and Scalar. Cheap and easy to use, but suffers from performance issues. 
* Bluehost (https://www.bluehost.com) - reasonably priced web hosting. Much more robust than Reclaim, but costs more. Still not expensive though. Dawn has used for years and has free hosting through their Education Spoke program.
* InMotion Hosting (https://www.inmotionhosting.com/) - Deidre recommends this hosting service over Bluehost and says they have great support. They offer significant discounts for educational uses also.
* Humanities Commons (https://hcommons.org) - "Discover the latest open-access scholarship and teaching materials, make interdisciplinary connections, build a WordPress Web site, and increase the impact of your work by sharing it in the repository. Brought to you by the MLA." Free, but Wordpress sites only and a repository to dump data sets, preprints, etc. Great for history, lit, and other humanities and humanistic social sciences.

Just want a website without all the fuss of a Content Management System like Wordpress? Host your website on GitHub! GitHub can host basic HTML5 sites (there are lots of great templates out there like https://html5up.net) and static site generators like Jekyll and Hugo.

GitHub is also a great place to share/publish your data and other project documents. It integrates with Zenodo, a research data repository (CERN), so you can publish a data set, create a release of that data, then archive it and make it citeable with a DOI in Zenodo.

Open Science Framework (OSF) (https://osf.ucla.edu) - a cloud platform for sharing, organizing, storing data, documentation, etc. for your research project. Integrates with GitHub, Google Drive, Box, etc. and has settings for private/public and minting DOIs. You can login with your UCLA BOL account. 

If you want to publish web apps and data visualizations, you can use platforms like Heroku (great for Ruby-based) and PythonAnywhere.
