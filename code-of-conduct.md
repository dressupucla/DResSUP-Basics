Learning new skills can be scary and our participants come from diverse backgrounds and experience levels. DResSUP seeks to provide a welcoming, professionally engaging, fun, and safe experience and ongoing community for everyone. All DResSUP participants are expected to abide by the Social Rules and Code of Conduct outlined below.

### Code of Conduct

DResSUP does not tolerate harassment in any form. Discriminatory language and 
imagery (including sexual) is not appropriate for any event venue, including 
talks, or any community channel such as Slack or the mailing list.

Harassment is understood as any behavior that threatens or demeans another
person or group, or produces an unsafe environment.  It includes offensive
verbal comments or non-verbal expressions related to gender, gender identity,
gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
body size, race, age, religious or political beliefs; sexual or
discriminatory images in public spaces (including online); deliberate
intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording;
sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical
contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

## Conflict Resolution

1. Initial Incident

    If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
    or have any other concerns, __and you feel comfortable speaking with
    the offender__, please inform the offender that he/she/ze has affected you 
    negatively. Oftentimes, the offending behavior is unintentional, and the 
    accidental offender and offended will resolve the incident by having 
    that initial discussion.
    
    DResSUP recognizes that there are many reasons speaking directly to
    the offender may not be workable for you (including but not limited to
    unfamiliarity with the participants and concerns for personal safety). If you don't feel comfortable 
    speaking directly with the offender for any reason, skip straight to 
    step 2.

2. Escalation 

    If the offender insists that he/she/ze did not offend, if offender is
    actively harassing you, or if direct engagement is not a good option
    for you at this time, then you will need a third party to step in. You can bring the issue to any of the DResSUP organizers by notifying them via email or in person.

## Sanctions

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately.  If a participant engages in harassing behavior, organizers may
take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender,
or expulsion from DResSUP.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all DResSUP-related
events and online communication channels.

We value everyone's participation in the DResSUP community, and will all
work to keep DResSUP a safe and friendly space for all participants!
