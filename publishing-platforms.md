## Publishing platforms

There are so many options for publishing your work online today. Here's a roundup of some options you might consider:

Wordpress, Omeka, and Scalar are all content management systems that you might find useful. These systems require a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack, so you will need dedicated server space with web hosting.

* HumSpace (http://humspace.ucla.edu/) - CDH's pilot program for UCLA students. Looks like it is Reclaim Hosting repackaged for UCLA. Offers one-click installs of Wordpress, Omeka, and Scalar. Pilot runs through October.
* Reclaim Hosting (https://reclaimhosting.com) - cheap web hosting for students. Offers one-click installs of Wordpress, Omeka, and Scalar. Cheap and easy to use, but suffers from performance issues. 
* Bluehost (https://www.bluehost.com) - reasonably priced web hosting. Much more robust than Reclaim, but costs more. Still not expensive though.
* Humanities Commons (https://hcommons.org) - "Discover the latest open-access scholarship and teaching materials, make interdisciplinary connections, build a WordPress Web site, and increase the impact of your work by sharing it in the repository. Brought to you by the MLA." Free, but Wordpress sites only and a repository to dump data sets, preprints, etc. Great for history, lit, and other humanities and humanistic social sciences.

Just want a website without all the fuss of a Content Management System like Wordpress? Host your website on GitHub! GitHub can host basic HTML5 sites (there are lots of great templates out there like https://html5up.net) and static site generators like Jekyll and Hugo.

GitHub is also a great place to share/publish your data and other project documents. It integrates with Zenodo, a research data repository (CERN), so you can publish a data set, create a release of that data, then archive it and make it citeable with a DOI in Zenodo.

If you want to publish web apps and data visualizations, you can use platforms like Heroku (great for Ruby-based) and PythonAnywhere.
